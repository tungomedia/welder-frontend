# WELDER frontend case

A manager needs insights about its members elearning progress. An elearning contains several steps and it's important for a manager to know what the progress is of each team member.

The example.png is showing the current situation:

## The task: How would *you* visualize this?

There is an API available which returns information about every user/elearning(course) entry. The `data.json` file contains the result of this API.

There is a Vue and React based example provided, but any framework is fine.

To start a simple webserver, run the following command from this directory:

`python3 -m http.server 8888`

And then access the page through `http://localhost:8888/vue.html`

If you feel like extra data from the API would help you improve the UI, feel free to add hypothetical data and use it in the UI.
